HELLO MY NAME IS UMESH S 
Today i'm going to learn the Cisco certified system technician (CCST) which is the first step in the IT Networking.
So by this i will learn and practise the lab activity also . By using a Cisco pacet tracer i'm going to have a practical knowledge .
Even i'm going to create a new  blog website so it might help for others .
So i'm excited and thrilled to take this journey.
